# 1st-task-ssh-key

SSH key is a type of an authentication which allow user to access to the our local computer or any system. In this case , we need to create a SSH key 
in our local computer so that we do not always have to key in our username and password everytime to push. To retrieve the ssh key which bind to our email,
we can access the terminal from GIT BASH.
